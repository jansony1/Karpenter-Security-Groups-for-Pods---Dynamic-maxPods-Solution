## 📋 Immediate Setup Tasks

### 1. Repository Description and Topics

**Go to**: Repository → Settings → General

**Description**: 
```
Dynamic maxPods calculation for Karpenter when Security Groups for Pods is enabled in Amazon EKS
```

**Topics** (add these tags):
```
kubernetes
aws
eks
karpenter
security-groups
maxpods
eni
ec2
devops
infrastructure
networking
containers
```

### 2. Enable Repository Features

**Go to**: Repository → Settings → General → Features

Enable:
- ✅ Issues
- ✅ Discussions  
- ✅ Projects (optional)
- ✅ Wiki (optional)

### 3. Create First Release

**Go to**: Repository → Releases → Create a new release

**Tag version**: `v2.0.0`
**Release title**: `v2.0.0 - Dynamic maxPods with Multi-Instance Support`

**Description**:
```markdown
## 🎉 Initial Release: Dynamic maxPods Calculation

Solves the critical issue where Security Groups for Pods reduces available pod capacity, causing scheduling failures in Amazon EKS clusters.

### ✨ Key Features
- **Smart Calculation**: Dynamic maxPods based on instance ENI limits
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatic Security Groups for Pods detection
- **30+ Instance Types**: Full support for T3, M5, C5, R5, M6i series
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive logging and validation

### 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jansony1/Karpenter-Security-Groups-for-Pods---Dynamic-maxPods-Solution.git
cd Karpenter-Security-Groups-for-Pods---Dynamic-maxPods-Solution
./deploy.sh
```

### 📊 Validation Results
- ✅ c5.large: maxPods=20 (29-9 reserved ENIs)
- ✅ m5.xlarge: maxPods=40 (58-18 reserved ENIs)
- ✅ t3.2xlarge: maxPods=40 (58-18 reserved ENIs)

### 🎯 Problem Solved
When Security Groups for Pods is enabled, trunk ENIs (`vpc.amazonaws.com/pod-eni`) are reserved, reducing available pod capacity. This solution automatically calculates the optimal maxPods value for each instance type.

### 📁 What's Included
- Dynamic maxPods calculation for 30+ instance types
- Automatic Security Groups for Pods detection
- Comprehensive deployment and validation scripts
- Complete documentation and examples
- GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows

See [README.md](README.md) for complete documentation.
```
