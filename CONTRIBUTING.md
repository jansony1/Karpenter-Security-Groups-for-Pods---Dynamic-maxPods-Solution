   - Error messages and logs
   - Steps to reproduce

### Code Contributions

#### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- kubectl configured to access an EKS cluster
- Basic understanding of Karpenter and Kubernetes
- Familiarity with AWS EC2 instance types and ENI limits

6. **Create a Pull Request**

#### Adding New Instance Types

When adding support for new instance types:

1. **Research ENI limits** for the instance type
2. **Update the calculation function** in `ec2nodeclass.yaml`:
   ```bash
   # Add new instance type
   "m7i.large")    default_max_pods=29;  reserved_enis=9 ;;
   ```
3. **Add to NodePool** instance type list in `nodepool.yaml`
4. **Update documentation** with the new instance type
